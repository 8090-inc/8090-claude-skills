## The Four Email Types

Every email fits one of four patterns. **Never mix types.**

### Type 1: Business Philosophy Sharing

**Use when**: Sharing a business principle or insight triggered by a conversation/event

**Structure**:
```
[Context sentence triggering the thought]

"[Quote from thought leader with attribution]"

Put more simply, [Distillation to first principles]
```

**Example**:
```
Ilya's questions today about if others will build back-prop reminded me of this important observation from Peter Thiel:

"[Long quote about distribution]"

Put more simply, Distribution > Product
```

**Length**: 100-200 words
**Greeting**: None
**Closing**: None

---

### Type 2: Personnel Communication

**Use when**: Announcing team changes, departures, new hires

**Structure**:
```
Dear Team,

[Direct statement of change - no euphemism]

[Acknowledgment sentence]

[Solution/continuity plan - 2 sentences]
```

**Example**:
```
Dear Team,

I let Krisha go today. I want to thank her for her effort and contributions and wish her well in whatever she does next. John Calzaretta will be helping us synthesize product related work on Software Factory until we find a suitable, full time replacement.
```

**Pattern: Acknowledge → State truth → Provide solution**

**Length**: 50-100 words
**Greeting**: "Dear Team," (only for personnel)
**Closing**: None

**Critical**: Balance honesty with respect. No euphemisms ("let go" not "parted ways"), but acknowledge contributions before stating next steps.

---

### Type 3: Tactical Directive

**Use when**: Giving feedback, providing direction, requesting action

**Structure**:
```
[What needs to happen - 1 sentence]
[Why - 1 sentence, only if not obvious]
Run it by [name] before you send it pls.
```

**Example**:
```
You need to acknowledge their perception in your note. Start with that so it starts with honesty. Run it by Max before you send it pls.
```

**Length**: 30-80 words
**Greeting**: None
**Closing**: None

**Key elements**:
- Direct instruction (no "I think maybe you should consider...")
- Minimal reasoning (only if needed for context)
- Clear accountability ("Run it by [name]")
- "pls" not "please"

---

### Type 4: Internal Team Updates

**Use when**: Weekly or monthly progress reports to internal team, cultural reinforcement, strategic context-setting

**Structure**:
```
Week Ending [Date]

(1) First major point
    (a) Sub-point one
    (b) Sub-point two
(2) Second major point
...
```

**Example**: See full examples in `format-internal-team-emails.md`

**Length**: 200-600 words (average ~350)
**Greeting**: None (jump straight to "Week Ending [Date]")
**Closing**: Forward-looking or gratitude

**Key elements**:
- Numbered hierarchy (1 → a → i)
- Energy modulation (celebrate/correct/teach/grateful/vulnerable)
- Visual aids (tables, diagrams) when applicable
- Specific praise for individuals/teams
- Can mix multiple topics (unlike Types 1-3)

**Note**: Internal team emails naturally have more personality and emotional range than tactical emails - that's appropriate for the format and helps build team culture.

## Language Patterns

### Opening Lines (No Preamble)

**Philosophy Sharing**:
- "[Name]'s questions today about... reminded me of..."
- "After our conversation about..."
- "This made me think of..."

**Personnel**:
- "I let [name] go today."
- "I'm excited to announce..."
- "Effective [date], [name] will..."

**Tactical**:
- "You need to..."
- "Run it by [name] before..."
- "Make sure to..."

### Closing Lines

**Philosophy Sharing**: Just ends. No closing.

**Personnel**: Just ends. No closing.

**Tactical**:
- "Run it by [name] before you send it pls."
- "Thanks to [name] for stepping up."
- Often just ends—no closing needed

### Abbreviations

**MUST use**:
- "pls" instead of "please"
- Names only (no "Dear," no "Mr./Ms.")

**DON'T use**:
- "thx" or other casual abbreviations
- Emojis
- Acronyms without first defining them (unless universally known)

## What Makes CP Emails Distinctive

### 1. Radical Brevity
- First draft is already short. Final draft is 30-50% shorter.
- Every word must justify its existence.
- No filler, no hedging, no politeness buffer.

### 2. Single Purpose Rule
**NEVER** mix topics:

❌ **Bad** (mixing topics):
```
Hey team,

Project update: we shipped the feature. Also, I let Krisha go today. Can someone review the budget spreadsheet by Friday? And reminder that the all-hands is moved to Thursday.
```

✅ **Good** (four separate emails):
```
Email 1: "Project update: we shipped the feature."
Email 2: [Personnel announcement about Krisha]
Email 3: "You need to review the budget spreadsheet by Friday. Run it by Max pls."
Email 4: "All-hands moved to Thursday 2pm."
```

### 3. No Formatting
- No bold, no italics, no underline
- No bullets (save for longer formats)
- Occasional line breaks for quotes
- That's it

### 4. Context Minimization
Assume recipient has context. Don't explain unless absolutely necessary.

❌ **Bad** (over-explaining):
```
Hey Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the document you're planning to send to the client tomorrow. Given the sensitivity of the situation and the client's history with similar projects, I think it would be valuable to get Max's perspective on this before it goes out, as he has experience with this particular client and understands their communication preferences.
```

✅ **Good** (assumes context):
```
You need to acknowledge their perception in your note. Start with that so it starts with honesty. Run it by Max before you send it pls.
```

## Quality Checklist

Before sending, verify:

### Length & Purpose
- [ ] Under 200 words (ideally under 100)
- [ ] Single purpose only (not mixing topics)
- [ ] Could I cut this in half and still communicate the point?

### Structure & Tone
- [ ] No greeting (except "Dear Team" for personnel)
- [ ] No sign-off (just name or nothing)
- [ ] Direct, no hedging ("You need to" not "It might be good to consider")
- [ ] "pls" not "please"

### Content
- [ ] Context minimal (assume recipient knows background)
- [ ] No filler words ("I think," "perhaps," "maybe")
- [ ] Active voice ("You need to" not "It would be good if")
- [ ] Clear accountability if requesting action ("Run it by Max")

### Formatting
- [ ] No bold, italics, or bullets
- [ ] Line breaks only for quotes (if applicable)
- [ ] Plain text only

### Type-Specific Checks

**Philosophy Sharing**:
- [ ] Quote properly attributed
- [ ] Distillation to first principles included
- [ ] Context sentence establishes why you're sharing this now

**Personnel**:
- [ ] Direct statement (no euphemisms)
- [ ] Acknowledgment of contributions
- [ ] Continuity plan provided
- [ ] Greeting: "Dear Team," used

**Tactical**:
- [ ] Clear instruction on what needs to happen
- [ ] Review/approval chain specified if applicable
- [ ] Reasoning minimal (only if essential for context)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Verbose Opening
```
❌ "I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you today to provide some guidance on the document that you'll be sending to the client..."

✅ "You need to acknowledge their perception in your note."
```

### Mistake 2: Multiple Topics
```
❌ Single email covering: project update + personnel change + meeting request + budget question

✅ Four separate emails, one per topic
```

### Mistake 3: Unnecessary Context
```
❌ "Given the client's history with similar projects and their communication preferences, as well as the sensitivity of the current business relationship..."

✅ "Run it by Max before you send it pls."
```

### Mistake 4: Hedging Language
```
❌ "It might be good to perhaps consider possibly running this by Max before sending?"

✅ "Run it by Max before you send it pls."
```

### Mistake 5: Formal Sign-offs
```
❌ "Best regards,
     Chamath Palihapitiya
     CEO, Social Capital"

✅ [Just ends, or "Chamath" if anything]
```

## When NOT to Use This Email Style

**Don't use for**:
- External client communications (requires more diplomatic framing)
- Legal/HR sensitive matters (may require formal documentation)
- First contact with someone unfamiliar with your style
- Crisis communications (may need more careful framing)

**Use customer brief format instead** if:
- Email exceeds 200 words
- Multiple topics need coverage
- Formal documentation required
- Tables or structured data needed
