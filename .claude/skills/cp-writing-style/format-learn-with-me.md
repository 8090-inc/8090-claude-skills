## When to Use Learn with Me

✅ **Use when**:
- Teaching complex topic that benefits from visual explanation
- Audience needs fundamentals + current state + future implications
- Data visualizations are central to the story
- Topic requires progressive disclosure (building complexity incrementally)
- Content consumed asynchronously (read like a book, not presented live)
- Educational deep-dive needed (40-80 slides worth)
- Visual storytelling more effective than prose

❌ **Don't use when**:
- Simple update (use email or customer brief)
- Data reporting (use customer brief)
- Policy recommendations (use policy ideas brief)
- Strategic reflection (use annual letter)

## Key Principles

### 1. One Idea Per Slide (STRICT)

❌ **Bad** (too many ideas):
```
Slide: "Market Dynamics"
- AI adoption increasing 45% YoY
- Three market phases: early, growth, mature
- Winner-take-most dynamics emerging
- Regulatory concerns growing
- 5 key players dominating
```

✅ **Good** (one idea):
```
Slide 1: "AI Adoption Accelerating"
45% YoY growth
[Chart showing trend]

Slide 2: "Three Market Phases"
[Diagram of early → growth → mature]

Slide 3: "Winner-Take-Most Dynamics"
[Chart showing market concentration]
```

### 2. Visual-First, Not Text-Heavy

Each slide should be dominated by visual elements. If you have more than 50 words on a slide, split it.

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Build complexity across slides:
- Slide 1: Simple concept
- Slide 2: Add nuance
- Slide 3: Show exception
- Slide 4: Integrate into broader framework

### 4. Citations on Every Data Slide

Every chart, graph, or statistic MUST have source attribution (bottom right).
