## Key Principles

### 1. Frontload Performance
**MUST** put performance table at the top before any narrative. No hiding bad years in prose.

✅ **Good**:
```
## Social Capital Performance Summary
[Complete table with all metrics upfront]

To the friends and supporters of Social Capital:
[Narrative begins after data]
```

❌ **Bad**:
```
To the friends and supporters:

This year had many interesting developments...
[Performance buried in section 3]
```

### 2. Educational Tone

Explain complex topics from first principles. Don't assume knowledge.

Pattern: "Conventionally, [X]... However, [Y]... [Explanation of why]"

### 3. Mix Macro + Portfolio

Balance between:
- Big-picture analysis (economy, technology trends, market dynamics)
- Specific portfolio updates (company deep-dives, metrics, progress)

Typical ratio: 60% macro analysis, 40% portfolio specifics

### 4. Intellectual Honesty

- Acknowledge what you got wrong
- Explain what surprised you
- Don't overstate successes or hide failures

Example:
```
"Neither scenario happened. Neither scenario happened." [Emphasizes surprise at prediction failure]
```

## Formatting Standards

### Headers
```
# 2024 Annual Letter (only one H1)
## Major Section Headers
### Subsection Headers
*Italicized* subsection leads
```

### Emphasis
- **Bold** for: key terms, metrics, important takeaways
- *Italics* for: subsection intros, emphasis within quotes
- Regular text for body

### Visual Elements

**Charts**: 3-8 per letter
- Line charts for trends
- Bar charts for comparisons
- Always include: title, axis labels, source attribution
- Single accent color (purple/brand color)

**Tables**: 1-3
- Performance summary (required)
- Portfolio holdings
- Appendix disclaimers
- Always labeled with clear headers and units

**White Space**:
- Paragraph breaks after 3-5 sentences
- Section breaks with headers
- Space around tables/charts
- No walls of text
