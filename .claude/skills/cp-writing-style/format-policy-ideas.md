## What Makes Policy Briefs Different

1. **Imperative Mode**: Command verbs throughout (Build, Create, Mandate)
2. **Branded Solutions**: Memorable system names ("HealthVault", "PayGrid")
3. **Bullet-Heavy**: 70-80% bulleted content
4. **No Tables/Charts**: Conceptual proposals, not data reporting
5. **Three-Level Nesting**: Deeper hierarchy for complex policies
6. **Categorized Impacts**: Outcomes by dimension (Public health, Economic, Innovation)

## Structure

### Title Pattern
```
# [Bold Declarative Goal]
*[Italicized Philosophical Subtitle]*
```

**Example**:
```
# Ideas to Revolutionize American Healthcare
*Building Trust in the Past While Automating the Future*
```

**Line 1**: Bold, aspirational, action-oriented
**Line 2**: Italicized philosophical framing

### Body Architecture

```
1. [Major Theme Area]
   1.1 [Specific Proposal with Action Name]
       [4-part micro-structure]
   1.2 [Specific Proposal with Action Name]
       [4-part micro-structure]

2. [Major Theme Area]
   2.1 [Specific Proposal]
   ...
```

**Typical Document**:
- 5-10 major thematic sections (numbered 1, 2, 3...)
- 2-5 sub-proposals per section (numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3...)

---

## The 4-Part Micro-Structure

Every sub-proposal follows this pattern:

### Part 1: Problem Statement (1-2 bullets)
- Context with specific data
- Root cause diagnosis
- May cite examples

**Example**:
```
● Billing, information and records represents up to 18% of all healthcare costs. Much of this gets borne in complicated heuristics and rules that can be streamlined through intelligent AI.
```

### Part 2: Proposed Solution (1 bullet with imperative)
- Opens with action verb: **Build, Create, Mandate, Develop, Launch, Establish**
- States specific mechanism
- Often includes branded name

**Example**:
```
● Build a real time, AI-enabled audit engine bot for CMS that prevents waste, fraud and abuse
```

### Part 3: Implementation Details (nested bullets)
- Uses ○ and ■ for 2-3 levels
- Specific mechanisms, requirements, features
- May include phased rollout (Phase 1, 2, 3)
- Parenthetical examples for clarity

**Example**:
```
● Build a real time, AI-enabled audit engine bot for CMS that prevents waste, fraud and abuse
  ○ Claims are checked in real-time for adherence to plans before reimbursement
  ○ Claims can be analyzed via AI to detect double payment to providers
● Mandate use of the Audit Bot at the state level to minimize state level Medicaid fraud
```

### Part 4: Impact Statement (bullet or section)
- Categorizes outcomes by dimension
- Common categories: Public health, Economic, Innovation, Sustainability
- Shows multi-dimensional benefits

**Example**:
```
● Impact:
  ○ Public health: Stabilized antibiotic markets to address growing resistance
  ○ Sustainability: Improved access to affordable, lifesaving therapies
  ○ Economic: Reduced financial barriers for smaller biotech firms
  ○ Innovation: Incentives for developing critical but less profitable drugs
```

## Language Patterns

### Imperative Opening Verbs

**Most Common**:
- **Build** (a system, a capability, a database)
- **Create** (a pathway, a program, an incentive)
- **Develop** (a solution, a mechanism, a framework)
- **Establish** (standards, requirements, programs)
- **Launch** (initiatives, projects, efforts)
- **Mandate** (requirements, compliance, adoption)
- **Require** (participation, adherence, reporting)

**Also Used**:
- Define, Implement, Enforce, Incorporate, Identify, Provide, Collaborate, Allow, Incentivize, Combine

### Proposal Naming Patterns

**Type 1: Descriptive Action**
- "AI-enabled FDA Reviewer"
- "Rapid, cheap and transparent settlement of claims"
- "Establishing a new FDA approval pathway for preventive therapies"

**Type 2: Branded System Names** (in quotes)
- Universal EHR Database ("HealthVault")
- Unified Reimbursement and Claims Data ("PayGrid")
- Open Access to Proprietary Medical Literature ("KnowledgeBridge")
- A Million Genomes, Proteomes, and Transcriptomes Project ("OmicsMap")

**Type 3: Program/Initiative Names**
- "Operation Warp Speed 2.0"
- "MAHA Prevention"
- "National Medical Licensure"

### Parenthetical Clarifications (Heavy Usage)

- Concrete examples: "(eg. 3% like Visa)"
- Clarifications: "(i.e. a real-time stars-like rating)"
- Specifications: "(approximately 150 private companies)"
- Alternatives: "(or pay interest)"

### Phased Implementation Language

```
● Phase 1: [Stage name]
  ■ [Specific activities]
● Phase 2: [Stage name]
  ■ [Specific activities]
● Phase 3: [Stage name]
  ■ [Specific activities]
```

## Formatting Standards

### Bullet Hierarchy (3 levels allowed)

```
● Primary bullet (main point)
  ○ Secondary bullet (supporting detail)
    ■ Tertiary bullet (sub-detail or example)
```

**Exception**: While other formats limit to 2 levels, policy briefs require 3 levels for complex proposals.

**When to Use Each Level**:
- **● Level 1**: Problem statements, main proposals, impact summaries
- **○ Level 2**: Implementation mechanisms, specific requirements, sub-proposals
- **■ Level 3**: Examples, clarifications, additional details

### Numbered Section Headers

```
1 Major Theme
1.1 Sub-proposal
1.2 Sub-proposal

2 Major Theme
2.1 Sub-proposal
```

### Emphasis

- **Bold** for: Proposal names, key metrics, critical requirements
- *Italics* for: Subtitle, subsection leads
- Regular for: All body text (90%+ of content)

### No Tables or Charts

Policy briefs focus on conceptual proposals. Data provided inline with text. If comparative data needed, use nested bullets instead.

## Complete Template

```markdown
# [Bold Declarative Goal]
*[Italicized Philosophical Subtitle]*

## 1 [Major Theme Area]

### 1.1 [Specific Proposal Name]

● [Problem statement with data]

● [Imperative verb] [solution with mechanism]
  ○ [Implementation detail]
  ○ [Implementation detail]
    ■ [Sub-detail or example]

● Impact:
  ○ [Dimension 1]: [Outcome]
  ○ [Dimension 2]: [Outcome]
  ○ [Dimension 3]: [Outcome]

### 1.2 [Specific Proposal Name]

[Repeat 4-part structure]

## 2 [Major Theme Area]

### 2.1 [Specific Proposal Name]

[Repeat 4-part structure]
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Command with Authority

Policy briefs prescribe, not suggest. Use imperatives.

❌ **Weak**:
```
● It would be beneficial to consider developing a system that could potentially help with fraud detection
```

✅ **Strong**:
```
● Build a real time, AI-enabled audit engine bot for CMS that prevents waste, fraud and abuse
```

### 2. Brand for Memorability

Create memorable names for proposed systems:
- "HealthVault" (not "Universal EHR Database System")
- "PayGrid" (not "Unified Reimbursement Data Platform")
- "OmicsMap" (not "Genomics Data Collection Project")

### 3. Quantify Problems

Every problem needs specific data:
- "up to 18% of all healthcare costs"
- "approximately 150 private companies"
- "6% compliance rate"

### 4. Multi-Dimensional Impacts

Show benefits across different domains:
- Public health
- Economic
- Innovation
- Sustainability
- Equity

Appeals to diverse stakeholder interests.
