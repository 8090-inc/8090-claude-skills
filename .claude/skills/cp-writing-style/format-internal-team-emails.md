## The Five Energy Modes

Internal team emails modulate energy more than any other CP format. Match intensity to purpose.

### Mode 1: CELEBRATORY (High Energy)

**When**: Team wins, hires closed, deals signed, execution breakthroughs

**Indicators**:
- ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Exclamation marks (!!!)
- Bold text on key achievements
- Specific praise for individuals/teams
- Superlatives ("FIRST week," "excellent")

**Example**:
```
(3) PETE DOWNEY!!!!
    (a) Let this be yet another reminder that we MUST present a technical "elitism" to the
        outside world.
```

**Language**:
- "I'm very excited to see..."
- "This was the FIRST week since we started the company where I felt we executed well"
- "Kicking ass," "excellent progress"

---

### Mode 2: PHILOSOPHICAL (Medium Energy, Teaching)

**When**: Sharing frameworks, building culture, explaining long-term vision

**Indicators**:
- Extended metaphors (books/chapters, sports, SpaceX phases)
- Rhetorical questions ("What does this mean?")
- Systematic explanations (numbered lists, frameworks)
- References to external learning (podcasts, books)

**Example**:
```
(1) Companies, like books, are written in chapters. Chapter 1, 2, 3 etc. But before Chapter 1
    is usually a prologue and/or an introduction.
    (a) Prologues provide critical information that foreshadows the rest of the book...
```

**Language**:
- "The distance between us and success is roughly about 1M errors"
- "Let me share a framework..."
- "I was looking at [topic] last night and realized..."

---

### Mode 3: CORRECTIVE (High Energy, Direct)

**When**: Problems to address, behavior to change, hard feedback

**Indicators**:
- Stark, unvarnished language
- Imperative commands
- Zero diplomatic buffer
- Specific directive on what to do instead

**Example**:
```
Taking a step back, my feedback to the team was stark and absolute: "You suck at politics.
Do not engage in them again. Escalate to me and get back to your strengths."
```

**Language**:
- "You suck at X. Do Y instead."
- "We need to find a way of solving these problems or we will fail"
- "This is unacceptable..."
- "I see several projects that are excruciatingly difficult..."

---

### Mode 4: GRATEFUL (Medium Energy, Appreciative)

**When**: Acknowledging team effort, thanking specific individuals

**Indicators**:
- Names specific people
- Describes specific actions/contributions
- Personal appreciation statements
- Often combined with other modes (celebrate + grateful)

**Example**:
```
(4) I am very excited as I end this week about the culture and energy we are developing. I
    really appreciate all of you and working through this rough patch.
```

**Language**:
- "I really appreciate [name]'s [specific action]"
- "I thank you for the hard work and push to get this done"
- "These folks deserve recognition..."

---

### Mode 5: VULNERABLE (Low Energy, Confessional)

**When**: Admitting mistakes, apologizing, explaining absence/delays

**Indicators**:
- Personal pronouns (I, not we)
- Specific admission of failure
- Commitment to do better
- Often opens email (Principle 3: Honesty First)

**Example**:
```
(1) It's been a few weeks between this and my last post. I appreciate the patience but I was
    more focused on fixing what seemed broken and should have done a better job of
    updating folks with my thinking. I will try to do better.
```

**Language**:
- "Apologies this is late!"
- "I should have done a better job of..."
- "I will try to do better"
- "When I was younger...Now, I'm just tired and miss my kids"

---

## Opening Patterns

**No greeting** - Jump straight to content with Week/Date header

**Common Openers**:

**1. Status/Progress**:
- "This week was a good one wrt the 'fundamentals'"
- "There was a lot of very good progress this week..."

**2. Apology/Acknowledgment** (Vulnerable):
- "Apologies this is late!"
- "It's been a few weeks between this and my last post"

**3. External Learning** (Philosophical):
- "I had a chance to listen to two podcasts this week..."
- "I was looking at failure modes in startups last night"

**4. Direct Observation** (Celebratory or Corrective):
- "I'm very excited to see the team coming together"
- "We are entering a new phase with [Customer]..."

---

## Closing Patterns

**1. Forward-Looking Action** (Most Common):
```
Let's get this new AH deal closed, let's hire a few more colleagues, let's launch ourselves
properly in 10 days and let's go!
```

**2. Gratitude**:
```
I really appreciate all of you and working through this rough patch.
```

**3. Long-Term Context**:
```
If all of this sounds exciting to you, it does to me as well. But for the next 5-10 years, we
are a Phase 1, Day 1 runt. We will need to grind but it will be worth it.
```

**4. Simple Send-Off**:
```
Have a wonderful long weekend.
```

**No signature** - Just ends

---

## Visual Aids Integration

### Tables (For Rankings, Metrics, Status)

**Use when**: Showing performance data, team contributions, customer pipeline

**Example**: Feedback leaderboard
```
| sabby@8090.inc  | 14 |
| rohit@8090.inc  | 10 |
| sina@8090.inc   |  5 |
```

**Context**: Always explain what table shows and why it matters

### Diagrams (For Concepts, Roadmaps)

**Use when**: Showing architecture, phases, evolution

**Example**: "Andrew presented our SF 'layer cake' which I am presenting below"
[Include visual]

**Note**: Must be embedded or attached, with context before and takeaway after

### Metrics Callouts

**Use bold or structure for key numbers**:
```
Closed key deals - three deals for $700k ARR closed this week
```

---

## Team Appreciation Techniques

### Pattern 1: Specific Praise

❌ **Generic**: "Great work everyone"
✅ **CP Style**: "I really appreciated Andrew and Vivian's ownership of their role and their contribution to 8090 last week and Alex and John's feedback this week. More of this!"

**Formula**: [Name] + [Specific Action] + [Why It Matters]

### Pattern 2: Public Recognition

```
(4) Contributions from many of our younger team is building momentum - Ale, Sepehr in
    particular have been kicking ass these past few weeks
```

**Why it works**: Names people, describes what they did, signals cultural values

### Pattern 3: Gratitude with Context

```
I really appreciate all of you and working through this rough patch. There will be more of
these as we grow and scale so remember what the last few weeks felt like and how you
feel now.
```

**Pattern**: Thank + Acknowledge difficulty + Forward-looking perspective

---

## Direct Feedback Frameworks

### Type 1: Stark Correction

**Structure**: "[Problem statement]. [Direct command]. [Reason]."

**Example**:
```
"You suck at politics. Do not engage in them again. Escalate to me and get back to your
strengths."
```

**When to use**: Serious misalignment, repeated mistakes, urgent correction needed

### Type 2: Constructive with Context

**Structure**: "[What didn't work] because [why]. Solution: [what to do instead]."

**Example**:
```
Our team did a poor job of managing this. The resolution, after I spoke with Suzanne Foster
(AH CEO) was to meet late in the week of 1/13 to hold an "EB 2.5" where we review our
collective priorities going into EB3.
```

**When to use**: Process failures, coordination problems, learnable mistakes

### Type 3: Standards Reinforcement

**Structure**: "[Observation]. [Standard expected]. [Consequence if not met]."

**Example**:
```
This week we had UCLA and I felt that we did not use our judgement and taste as well as
we could have. It is critical that we hold ourselves to the highest quality bar possible.
```

**When to use**: Quality concerns, cultural reinforcement, expectations-setting

## Complete Email Examples

Below are 5 full "Top of Mind" emails from 8090.ai (Jan-May 2025) demonstrating different tones and approaches for internal team updates.

---

### Example 1: Celebratory + Stakes Clarification

**Week Ending 3/14/25**

(1) There was a lot of very good progress this week along with the right kinds of setbacks and mistakes. What does this mean? There are setbacks and mistakes that are observable and can lead to better processes and outcomes. There are other kinds of setbacks and mistakes, however, that, at their root cause, are because of laziness, sloppiness or lack of care. The good news is that the mistakes, errors and setbacks this week were the former. Combined with our wins this week, **this was the FIRST week since we started the company where I felt we executed well.** In other words, our "time to first good week" was about 9 months. That should not be taken as a bad thing. It should be taken for what it means: there is an incredibly high bar if you want to build an indelible company. When you join a startup, you are buying a ticket to a rollercoaster at an amusement park. So when you buy the ticket, it means taking the ride: pushing beyond your comfort zone and what you think is possible, taking your breath away in moments, wishing it would stop in others. This week, you collectively achieved a lot and are creating the momentum to help make us a great business:
    (a) Closed key talent - Alex starts next week
    (b) Closed key deals - three deals for $700k ARR closed this week
    (c) Executed and delivered for our core customers - great progress in both Social Capital and Adapt Health
    (d) Contributions from many of our younger team is building momentum - Ale, Sepehr in particular have been kicking ass these past few weeks
    (e) Communicated precisely to our partners - this is an often overlooked but important way to maintain our reputation and integrity with them

(2) Your weekly reminder: Software Factory is critical to our success. It needs to be held to the same quality standards as everything else we do and it needs to be usable in the wild ASAP. I'm excited more and more by what is possible here and for releases in the upcoming few months.

(3) Let's try to string a few more weeks like this one together. You will be surprised both by how you feel and what you are capable of if we do.

---

### Example 2: Corrective (Stark Feedback)

**Week Ending 1/10/25**

(1) We spent several hours on Friday and Saturday triaging a small fire at AH. In short, there were changing priorities going into EB3 that seemed random and not well socialized amongst AH executives. This related to working across Diabetes and deprioritizing opening up all fax lines in other lines of business. Our team did a poor job of managing this. The resolution, after I spoke with Suzanne Foster (AH CEO) was to meet late in the week of 1/13 to hold an "EB 2.5" where we review our collective priorities going into EB3. Taking a step back, my feedback to the team was stark and absolute: **"You suck at politics. Do not engage in them again. Escalate to me and get back to your strengths."** More generally, this is an important reminder that as a startup, our competence is not political but technical. Successful startups compete in games they can win: technology, ingenuity, productivity. They also avoid games they cannot win like lobbying, politics. We need to do a better job of keeping this in mind. We are not at Amazon, Google, Meta or other big companies anymore. We are a noble startup whose only path to viability is through innovation. If the work you are doing can't be addressed in this dimension, you should escalate and stop doing it.

(2) We kicked off our first product strategy meeting for Software Factory. I am increasingly convinced that if we execute on this properly, we will build something truly unique but also something that offers businesses compounding value for being a part of it. This "network effect" will be non obvious initially, but if we solve enough companies' problems, the blueprint will come into focus.

(3) I had an initial meeting with Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks. He is interested in exploring Software Factory and how it can help him and Lilly depreciate some old systems. This is the 12th largest company in the S&P500 so it will be an interesting test if we are ready to take on this kind of customer.

(4) We are making good progress moving some of our deals through the pipeline. But it needs to be faster and the deal sizes need to be bigger if we are to achieve our $20M goal for CY2025.

---

### Example 3: Philosophical (Extended Metaphor)

**Week Ending 2/14/25**

(1) More sales traction this week is both exciting and terrifying - our top of funnel is just getting going but I think we should push towards $20M in bookings for 2025. As we fill more top of funnel demand, I am 100% convinced that you will iterate towards a model of delivering on the promises we make to customers. At the same time, we will struggle with many new customers at this moment as we figure out how to deliver on expectations with our existing customers. This tension is a necessary boundary condition for success because it creates pain and suffering that we must fight through and figure out in order to be great.
    (a) To this end, I was really happy to see the team make organizational improvements to try and deliver on AH this week. Further, expanding this framework beyond AH to SC and CVMG shows that we are capable of proactively addressing the things that slow us down from delivering on expectations.

(2) We started to explore taking on an existing product that has 3000+ customers on behalf of a company who wants to exit the space. This is quite interesting because we are essentially taking a finished product and managing it going forward.
    (a) We can use this as a way to train Refinery and train our Software Factory and HPC efforts. How? By using the finished product as the counterfactual. And then writing a PRD from scratch and using our SF and HPC efforts to make it. Measuring the cycle time and quality vs the counterfactual may help us harden and accelerate our efforts on SF and HPC.

(3) I want to set some context. This is quite repetitive but it's important to make sure you internalize this - which is often easier to do when you hear something many times.
    (a) [Image of SpaceX Raptor 1, 2, 3 engine evolution]
    (b) When you look at SpaceX, you may get lost in their valuation ($350B+) or revenues ($8B+) or their predictability. But you would be missing something very important which the image above demonstrates. SpaceX was started in 2003 and until 2011 was sideways. They had a small success in 2008 but it wasn't until the beginning of 2011 that they started to generate momentum. This was the first time that they saw predictability and reusability from Raptor1. In many ways, this was the first phase of SpaceX…and it took 8 years! Phase1 is all about engineering exploration, troubleshooting, problem solving and tedious blocking and tackling. Its not glamorous and often times can seem very unrewarding. That said, its the ticket to run the race. Phase 2 (Raptor2) is the scaling phase where you are no longer a novelty but a market leader. That is a 10+ year journey if meticulous improvement and iteration. Then Phase 3 starts - this can be a multi-decade period where you are redefining the future.
    (c) The point in this is that we can be on an equally exciting journey. But it will be a long time and it will be hard. Phase1 is where we are now - but if we figure out how to build SF and HPC as we build a strong revenue business, we have a shot at Phase2. Phase 2 will allow us to grow into a multi-hundred billion dollar company. Phase 3 will be about building Cofounder and can be measured in Trillions.
    (d) If all of this sounds exciting to you, it does to me as well. But for the next 5-10 years, we are a Phase 1, Day 1 runt. We will need to grind but it will be worth it.

### Example 4: Quantification + Philosophy

**Week Ending 5/23/25**

(1) It's been a few weeks between this and my last post. I appreciate the patience but I was more focused on fixing what seemed broken and should have done a better job of updating folks with my thinking. I will try to do better.

(2) What I am most excited about is the agency I see amongst all the DRIs - whether it's a CSE project, an IE project, working on SF, recruiting or building the branding of 8090 and everything in between. I see a lot more energy and ownership. We will make many mistakes as we implement this DRI model but mistakes will be the lifeblood of our success. Identifying what didn't go right is an opportunity for us to learn, acquire some knowledge which eventually leads to wisdom and get closer to success.

(3) **The distance between us and success is roughly about 1M errors.** I don't know this to be exactly true but its more of an order of magnitude to express that our success is bounded by learning - and the fastest way to learn is to try something and find out whether it worked or it didn't and then iterate.
    (a) Making more errors means we are trying stuff faster, making progress faster and finding ultimate success sooner. Embrace the knowledge that comes from this and learning to support your colleagues as they try things and get them wrong is a superpower!
        (i) The only caveat to this is to learn from what hasn't worked to develop a situational awareness about why it didn't so we don't repeat the same errors twice. This doesn't mean to not repeat the same experiment but it's to be aware why it didn't work at one point in time so if you chose to try the approach again, the boundary conditions, as you see them, are different. This will allow the outcome to be different as well.

(4) I am very excited as I end this week about the culture and energy we are developing. I really appreciate all of you and working through this rough patch. There will be more of these as we grow and scale so remember what the last few weeks felt like and how you feel now. Hopefully it's more exciting, energized and curious.

(5) Let's get this new AH deal closed, let's hire a few more colleagues, let's launch ourselves properly in 10 days and let's go!

(6) Have a wonderful long weekend.

### Example 5: First-Principles Teaching + Vulnerability

**Week Ending 2/28/25**

(1) I was looking at the failure modes in startups last night. As it turns out there are three kinds of failure:
    (a) Fraud - 2%
    (b) Honest Failure or Mis-execution - 98%

(2) The reason this is important is that it allows us to have an honest discussion about what is currently not working at 8090. This shows that the odds that any of us are stealing some extra food or cheating the company through Uber reimbursements is a negligible risk. What it means, more importantly however, is that whenever something isn't going well or we are worried about work we haven't done yet, the reason lies in one of two reasons - **we are dumb or we are not coordinated well.** The former is also likely untrue - most humans are within the same genetic distribution of intelligence as most others with small outliers on either side. So the likeliest reason that things don't happen as you would like, or companies don't work, or products fail etc lie in the misexecution and lack of coordination that emerges as we try to do more difficult things. This begs the question, how do we solve this?
    (a) Solving coordination problems start with **communicating hyper bluntly and honestly** about what isn't working. If you can't say it, it holds back the process of repairing a broken process.
    (b) Another critical factor in solving coordination problems is knowing upfront that everyone will bring their own **personal experiences and biases** to the discussion and, as a result, the proposed solution will be littered with bad assumptions.
        (i) So knowing this, when trying to fix a broken process, project or effort is to describe the problem so honestly that it's almost uncomfortable to even write it - it may include names and receipts to make the point. This can feel confrontational or unkind but without the ground truth you can't take the next step.
        (ii) After it's clear what the problem is, we need to document a solution that is inoculated from the natural biases we have.
        (iii) The solution may mean that some people are miscast in the wrong role or even in the company. That's difficult to hear but it may be true.

(3) Why am I bringing this up? We are in an important phase of the business where it may look ok from the outside, but this is the moment where the compounding rate of errors we allow to remain in the system today will kill us 18-24 months from now. I see several projects that are excruciatingly difficult and may be leading to burnout and frustration. I also see efforts to brute force things versus say the hard part out loud and retool. We need to find a way of solving these problems or we will fail.
