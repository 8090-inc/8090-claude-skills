## Decision Trees

### "Should I use bullets or prose?"

```
Is this a Policy Ideas Brief?
  YES → Use bullets (70-80% bullets)
  NO ↓

Is this a list of parallel items or action steps?
  YES → Use bullets
  NO ↓

Is this explaining causal relationships or building an argument?
  YES → Use narrative prose
  NO ↓

DEFAULT → Use narrative prose
```

### "Pattern 1 or Pattern 2 for Customer Brief?"

```
Multiple projects needing comparison?
  YES ↓

Reader already has context?
  YES ↓

Time-constrained (< 5 min)?
  YES → Pattern 2 (Decision-Driven: table-first)
  NO → Pattern 1 (Strategic Hook: narrative-first)
```

### "Should I cut more words?"

```
After first draft: Cut 50%
After second draft: Cut 30% more
After third draft: If uncertain, cut 20% more

Target reductions:
- Corporate jargon → 240 words to 47 words (80%)
- Email → Always under 200 words
- Customer brief → 50% reduction typical
```

## RIZZ CHEATSHEET (Principle 11)

**For full deep-dive**: Load `advanced-rhetoric.md`

### Energy Modulation Matrix

| Purpose | Energy Level | When to Use | Example Phrases |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Celebration** | 8-10/10 | Team wins, deals closed, hiring success | "FIRST week where I felt we executed well," "PETE DOWNEY!!!!" |
| **Correction** | 8-9/10 | Direct feedback, urgent fixes | "You suck at X. Do Y instead." |
| **Teaching** | 4-6/10 | Philosophical lessons, frameworks | "The distance between us and success is ~1M errors" |
| **Gratitude** | 5-7/10 | Acknowledging team effort | "I really appreciate all of you" |
| **Vulnerability** | 3-5/10 | Admitting mistakes, apologizing | "I should have done a better job... I will try to do better" |

### Selective Vulnerability Strategy

**What to Admit** (Strategic):
- ✅ Past financial errors with specific numbers: "$3-4B Bitcoin mistake"
- ✅ Intellectual evolution: "I was wrong about Trump"
- ✅ Personal struggles: "I'm just tired and miss my kids"
- ✅ Process failures: "should have done better job of updating you"

**What to Avoid** (Defensive):
- ❌ Real-time contradictions (don't admit error while making same error)
- ❌ Generic apologies ("mistakes were made")
- ❌ Deflecting power/privilege

**Pattern**: Pre-emptive vulnerability → permission for confidence

### Metaphor Systems Library

| Domain | Use Case | CP Example |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Books/Chapters** | Company evolution stages | "Prologue → Introduction → Chapter 1" |
| **Sports** | Team building, execution | "Fundamentals," "buying ticket to rollercoaster" |
| **Science** | Processes, constraints | "Forcing functions," "boundary conditions" |
| **Journey/Phases** | Long-term vision | "SpaceX Phase 1 (8 yrs) → Phase 2 (10+ yrs) → Phase 3" |

### Feedback Patterns

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Direct Correction** | "[Problem]. [Command]. [Reason]." | "You suck at politics. Escalate to me and get back to your strengths." |
| **Constructive** | "[What didn't work] because [why]. Solution: [action]." | "Team did poor job managing this. We'll meet late in week to review priorities." |
| **Appreciative** | "[Name]'s [specific action] [why it matters]" | "I appreciated Andrew and Vivian's ownership of their role" |

### Intellectual Flex (Show, Don't Tell)

**Tactics**:
- 🎯 **Data Fluency**: Drop specific numbers casually ("$150B AI investment," "Fed cut from 5.33% to 4.75%")
- 📚 **"Learn with Me"**: Frame as learning journey ("I was looking at failure modes in startups last night")
- ❓ **Valorize "I don't know"**: Makes actual knowledge claims more credible
- 🗣️ **Plain Language + Density**: Complex ideas in simple words

**What NOT to do**: "I've studied this extensively," "As an expert," "I know a lot about..."

### Contrarian Positioning Formula

**When to Use**: Public thought leadership, building personal brand

**Formula**: [Elite Credential] + [Insider Experience] + [Public Rejection of Consensus] = Authority + Authenticity

**Examples**:
- Former Facebook VP critiques social media
- VC calls VCs "soulless cowards"
- Elite education holder says "college was exact opposite of good advice"

**Risk**: Must pre-empt hypocrisy with Principle 3 (Honesty First)

### Debate Tactics (Quick Ref)

**For high-stakes public communications only**:

1. **Socratic Hammer**: Repeated questioning to expose contradictions ("Who says that? Who says that?")
2. **Rephrasing Trap**: "That's what you're saying. You may not know that's what you're saying, but that's what you're saying."
3. **Data Asymmetry**: Provide specific numbers, challenge opponent's vague claims
4. **False Binary**: "Either rise to meet the moment or disappear"

### Zinger Construction

**5-Element Formula**:
1. Binary/contrastive structure ("X > Y," "X vs. Y")
2. Name enemies specifically ("soulless cowards" not "some people")
3. Unexpected insider attack (attack own class/industry)
4. Specific numbers ("$3-4B mistake" not "big mistake")
5. Emotional honesty (raw feeling words: "vacant and empty," "pain and suffering")

**Example**: "Often wrong, never in doubt" (binary, 4 words, memorable)

### RIZZ Context Calibration

| Context | RIZZ Components to Use | Skip |
|---------|------------------------|------|
| **Internal team emails** | Energy modulation, vulnerability, metaphors | Contrarian positioning, debate tactics |
| **External partners** | Intellectual flex, measured energy | Vulnerability, debate tactics |
| **Public/investors** | FULL RIZZ (all components) | None |
| **Tactical emails** | None (pure efficiency) | All |

### RIZZ Quality Check

Before sending high-stakes communication:
- [ ] Energy level matches purpose (celebrate/correct/teach)?
- [ ] Vulnerability strategic (specific numbers, not generic)?
- [ ] Metaphor system sustained throughout (if teaching)?
- [ ] At least one quotable zinger (binary + specific + emotional)?
- [ ] Intellectual flex demonstrated through deployment, not declaration?

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "We saw significant growth" | "Revenue grew 47% QoQ from $2.1M to $3.1M" |
| "Mistakes were made" | "We made mistakes. I learned from them." |
| "Despite some challenges..." | State the challenge first with data, then wins |
| Email > 200 words | Split into multiple emails, one per topic |
| "Over the next 100 days" | Use specific days: "Over the next 80 days" |
| Missing "why" | Add: "Because [reason], [action]" |
| Passive voice | "We did X" not "X was done" |
| Table without context | Add: "Calculated using [method] assuming [assumptions]" |

## Metric Presentation Patterns

### Dual Format (Percentage + Dollar)
```
This 30% drop-off (~$3M/yr) of lost potential revenue
```

### Before/After Comparison
```
Revenue grew 47% QoQ from $2.1M to $3.1M
```

### Range with Context
```
Total ROI: $2.4M/yr in cost (upper end) → $20.7M/yr in upside (low end)
```

### Conservative Estimate
```
Lost revenue opportunity to well north of $250M/yr
```

---

## Timeline Precision Signals

**Near-term** (use specific days):
- ✅ "Over the next 80 days..."
- ❌ "Over the next 100 days..."

**Medium-term** (use quarters + months):
- ✅ "All three operational by Q4 2026"
- ✅ "Project 1: May 2026, Project 2: July 2026"
- ❌ "Projects will complete in 2026"

---

## Header Hierarchy

```
# Title (only one H1)
## Major Section
### Subsection
```

**Maximum nesting**: 3 levels
**Never skip levels**: Don't jump from H1 to H3

---

## The 30-Second Test

Before sending any communication, ask:

1. **Purpose**: Can I state the single purpose in one sentence?
2. **Data**: Did I replace adjectives with numbers?
3. **Honesty**: Did I acknowledge failures first?
4. **Brevity**: Could I cut 20% more without losing meaning?
5. **Action**: Is it clear what happens next?

If any answer is "NO," revise before sending.
