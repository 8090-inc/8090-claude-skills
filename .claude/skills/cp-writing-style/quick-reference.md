## Decision Trees

### "Should I use bullets or prose?"

```
Is this a Policy Ideas Brief?
  YES → Use bullets (70-80% bullets)
  NO ↓

Is this a list of parallel items or action steps?
  YES → Use bullets
  NO ↓

Is this explaining causal relationships or building an argument?
  YES → Use narrative prose
  NO ↓

DEFAULT → Use narrative prose
```

### "Pattern 1 or Pattern 2 for Customer Brief?"

```
Multiple projects needing comparison?
  YES ↓

Reader already has context?
  YES ↓

Time-constrained (< 5 min)?
  YES → Pattern 2 (Decision-Driven: table-first)
  NO → Pattern 1 (Strategic Hook: narrative-first)
```

### "Should I cut more words?"

```
After first draft: Cut 50%
After second draft: Cut 30% more
After third draft: If uncertain, cut 20% more

Target reductions:

| "We saw significant growth" | "Revenue grew 47% QoQ from $2.1M to $3.1M" |
| "Mistakes were made" | "We made mistakes. I learned from them." |
| "Despite some challenges..." | State the challenge first with data, then wins |
| Email > 200 words | Split into multiple emails, one per topic |
| "Over the next 100 days" | Use specific days: "Over the next 80 days" |

## Metric Presentation Patterns

### Dual Format (Percentage + Dollar)
```
This 30% drop-off (~$3M/yr) of lost potential revenue
```

### Before/After Comparison
```
Revenue grew 47% QoQ from $2.1M to $3.1M
```

### Range with Context
```
Total ROI: $2.4M/yr in cost (upper end) → $20.7M/yr in upside (low end)
```

### Conservative Estimate
```
Lost revenue opportunity to well north of $250M/yr
```

## Timeline Precision Signals

**Near-term** (use specific days):
- ✅ "Over the next 80 days..."
- ❌ "Over the next 100 days..."

**Medium-term** (use quarters + months):
- ✅ "All three operational by Q4 2026"
- ✅ "Project 1: May 2026, Project 2: July 2026"
- ❌ "Projects will complete in 2026"

## Header Hierarchy

```
# Title (only one H1)
## Major Section
### Subsection
```

**Maximum nesting**: 3 levels
**Never skip levels**: Don't jump from H1 to H3

## The 30-Second Test

Before sending any communication, ask:

1. **Purpose**: Can I state the single purpose in one sentence?
2. **Data**: Did I replace adjectives with numbers?
3. **Honesty**: Did I acknowledge failures first?
4. **Brevity**: Could I cut 20% more without losing meaning?
5. **Action**: Is it clear what happens next?

If any answer is "NO," revise before sending.

**For customer briefs** (most common):
1. `core-principles.md`
2. `format-customer-briefs.md`
